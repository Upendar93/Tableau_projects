🚦 Traffic Accident & Casualties Analysis Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive visual analytics dashboard designed to analyze road traffic casualties across multiple dimensions such as road type, day of week, time of day, and weather conditions.

The goal of this analysis is to identify high-risk patterns and temporal trends in traffic accidents that can support road safety planning, policy decisions, and preventive measures.

📊 Dashboard Components & Insights
🔹 Sheet 1 – Casualties by Road Type & Day

Treemap visualization

Shows casualty distribution across:

Road type (e.g., Single carriageway)

Day of the week

Larger blocks indicate higher casualties

Helps identify road infrastructure types with higher risk

📌 Key Insight
Single carriageways consistently show the highest number of casualties across most days.

🔹 Sheet 2 – Casualties by Hour of Day & Weather

Stacked area chart

X-axis: Hour of day (0–24)

Y-axis: Number of casualties

Color-coded by weather conditions:

Fine weather

Rain

Fog

Snow

Wind conditions

📌 Key Insights

Peak casualty hours occur during morning (7–9 AM) and evening (4–6 PM) rush hours

Fine weather still accounts for the majority of casualties, indicating traffic volume impact

Adverse weather increases risk but occurs less frequently

🔹 Sheet 3 – Casualties by Day of Week

Bar chart showing percentage contribution

Highlights distribution of casualties across weekdays and weekends

📌 Key Insight

Friday records the highest percentage of casualties

Sunday shows comparatively lower accident involvement

🎯 Key Findings

Road design plays a critical role in accident severity

Rush-hour traffic is a major contributor to casualties

Weather conditions amplify risk but are secondary to traffic density

End-of-week travel patterns increase accident probability
